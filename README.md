# gobyexample
Some small code snippets I am working through implementing different features of Go. Currently following https://gobyexample.com/. 

For this repository, each file is it's own Go example. 

## Usage
1. Run an example (e.g., hello-world.go):
    ```
    make run example=hello-world
    ```
